Project Description:
The recipe website is an educational project developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6+. 
The main goal of the project is to create a semantically correct and accessible web application that provides convenient navigation and an enjoyable user experience.

Project Features:
Semantic Structure:
- The homepage is organized using semantic tags like 'header', 'main', and 'footer'.
- The recipe directory is implemented with 'nav' and lists ('ul', 'li').
- Each recipe page is structured with 'article', 'section', and 'h1'â€“'h6' for headings.

Aesthetic Design:
- Styling is done using CSS to create a clean and modern interface.
- Responsive design elements ensure proper display across different devices.

Interactivity:
- Basic functionality implemented with JavaScript, such as highlighting the current navigation link, collapsible ingredient lists, or simple animations.
- A feature to add recipes to favorites (without server-side data storage).

Cross-Browser Compatibility:
- The website is tested in popular browsers to ensure consistent behavior.

SEO Optimization:
- Meta tags such as 'title', 'meta description', and 'meta keywords' are used to enhance search engine visibility.
- Semantic tags improve content hierarchy and accessibility, further boosting SEO rankings.
- Descriptive alt attributes are added to all images to improve discoverability and accessibility.

Favicon Integration:
- A favicon has been added to improve user experience and provide a professional look in browser tabs.

This project demonstrates the practical application of modern web technologies, web development principles, basic SEO techniques, and attention to detail in user interface design.
